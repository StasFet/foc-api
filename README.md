# FOC API
## Introduction

Hello! This is just a little project to learn how to make a REST API. I haven't made one before, but I thought it seems interesting and useful so here I am. Here is a little list of the tools/techniques used for this project:

- REST API design
- Golang
- SQLite
- Golang standard library's `net/http` module (I initially wanted to use gin, but decided to use this to make a more lightweight app)
- Docker
